## What is xExchange?

xExchange is a platform for trading and engaging with decentralized finance running on the MultiversX Network. A gateway for the next billion people into the digital economy.

It is the second iteration of Maiar DEX - you can think of it as Maiar DEX 2.0 - and it is using the same powerful and scalable financial technology.

Built by the same team that has built the blockchain protocol. Owned by the community.

## What's special about the xExchange?

**Blazing fast**: State sharding technology makes all DeFi operations on the xExchange execute in a fast and reliable manner while keeping up with any volume of demand.

**Inexpensives**: Costs are negligible so everyone can enjoy everything from simple trades to deploying complex strategies.

**Slick**: Intuitive experiences will ease the next billion people into digital finance.

**Supercharged**: xExchange is the first DeFi platform to debut the concept of Energy. It takes the “time lock” mechanism for its governance token to the next level of utility.

**Metastaking**: Unlocks three different income streams for liquidity providers: Swap Fees, Farm Rewards and Staking Rewards.

**Metabonding**: Supercharged Web3 community building for participating projects.

**xPortal App (1.2M+ users)**: Seamless onboarding - you can use MultiversX’s xPortal App to login and sign transactions on the xExchange. As secure as a Ledger hardware wallet, as convenient as Face ID + tapping on the screen. Additionally, xPortal is super easy to use - it automatically and securely creates a wallet in seconds, using just a phone number (not shared, only a hash of it is used one time for wallet creation).

## What is xMEX?

It is the tokenized commitment of long term explorers towards building the new frontiers of finance. Equivalent in value with MEX, xMEX is committed to a user’s account for a certain period of time. This “lock” duration is represented as Energy, which opens access to more rewards and perks.

## What is Energy?

Energy is a new account attribute that scales with the amount of xMEX owned, and the time it is locked for. More energy means higher APRs and a bigger share of the xExchange fees. This powerful new concept aligns incentives for liquidity providers, traders and MEX owners.
