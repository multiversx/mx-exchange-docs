:::info
xExchange V3 introduced a simpler Staking product, a streamlined way to earn yield by staking a single type of token.
:::

Unlike traditional staking in [liquidity pools](/products/liquidity) or [farms](/products/farms) that require pairing assets, Staking simplifies the processâ€”allowing you to stake one token and earn rewards effortlessly.

With Staking, you can earn yield on popular tokens. As this feature evolves, more tokens will be added, giving you even more options to stake your favorites.

## Benefits of Simple Staking

- **No Impermanent Loss:** Since youâ€™re staking only one token, you avoid the risk of impermanent loss associated with asset pairs in AMMs.
- **Effortless Staking:** Forget about juggling positions or moving tokens. Staking offers a hassle-free experience for earning rewards.
- **Daily Rewards:** Earn rewards daily based on the APR, which you can claim at the end of the staking period. The longer you stake, the higher the potential APR.
- **Boosted APR from Energy:** Boost your rewards by staking [xMEX](/xmex-and-energy/xmex) in fixed-term pools to gain [Energy](/xmex-and-energy/what-is-energy).
