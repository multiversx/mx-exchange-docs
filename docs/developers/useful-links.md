## Environments
- [https://xexchange.com](https://xexchange.com) - mainnet exchange
- [https://devnet.xexchange.com](https://devnet.xexchange.com) - devnet exchange stack closely follows a subset of the mainnet setup, with high confidence new features rolled out close to the mainnet rollouts; used as the go to environment for developers to try out their features and integrations.
- [https://testnet.xexchange.com](https://testnet.xexchange.com) - testnet exchange stack can loosely follow the mainnet setup, with highly experimental new features rolled out way ahead of mainnet rollouts; used for early and wildly experimental development efforts.
