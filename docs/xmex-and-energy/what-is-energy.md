Any xMEX has attributed energy proportional to the locked period.

1 xMEX gives 1 Energy Point per day it is locked for.

Example:

You own 100 xMEX, which are locked for 1 year (360 days).

You will start out with 100\*360 = 36000 Energy and after each day, you will have 100 less Energy.

The amount of an account’s Energy determines the rate of rewards for participating in xExchange.

Simply put, more energy means more rewards:

- higher APR for farms
- bigger portion of xExchange fees
- Metabonding rewards
- other perks

Each day, as the xMEX gets closer to it’s unlock day, it will lose 1 point.

However, losing energy does not mean you lose your tokens. Your tokens stay the same. You lose energy because your tokens are nearing their unlock date.
