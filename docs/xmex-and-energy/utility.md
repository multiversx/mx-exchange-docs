:::info
The new Energy system not only rewards users based on xMEX holdings, but also on lock duration. xMEX has special benefits, rewards and usecases across the entire exchange and even other products.
:::

## ⚡️ Boosted Rewards from Farms

Each [Farm](/xexchange-products/yield-farming.md) has base rewards and boosted rewards. While base rewards are paid out equally to everyone, based on their share of the farm (APR is shown for each farm), boosted rewards are paid only to Energy holders. The boosted rewards increase based on how much Energy you have, giving you the potential to significantly enhance your returns.

From all emissions that go towards a farm, 40% go to base rewards while 60% go towards the boosted rewards, to reward those with Energy. Learn more in [Yield Farming](/xexchange-products/yield-farming.md)

## ⚡️ Boosted APR from Dual Farms

Similarly to how Farms work, boosted rewards from Dual Farms are paid only to Energy holder. Learn more in [Dual Farms](/xexchange-products/dual-farms.md)

## ⚡️ Metabonding Rewards

[Metabonding](/xexchange-products/metabonding.md) rewards are exclusively distributed to users who have Energy.

## ⚡️ xMEX emissions

5% of the xMEX emissions will go to Energy holders. There is no need to stake your xMEX. Just holding it in the wallet is enough to earn rewards.

## ⚡️ xLaunchpad Tickets

There are two different tier systems. One is based on staked EGLD, while the other is based on energy.

## ⚡️ Governance Power

You are able to vote on governance proposals, based on your Energy.

## ⚡️ Swap Fees Rewards

0.05% of all swap fees go towards all users with Energy, while another 0.05% go towards buying back and burning MEX.

## ⚡️ Energy Removal Fees Rewards

When reducing or removing the energy of your xMEX, you pay a penalty. 50% of that penalty gets burnt, while the other half gets distributed to all users with Energy.

Last but not least, it’s important to stress that it is possible to earn rewards from all reward streams at the same time. You can have your xMEX added with EGLD in a liquidity farm and benefit from swap rewards, farm rewards, boosted farm rewards, metabonding, governance, xLaunchpad tiers, the swap fees rewards and energy removal rewards **simultaneously**.
