:::info
MEX is the fully community-owned token that drives xExchange. It plays a key role in governance, fueling the ongoing decision-making that keeps xExchange at the forefront of innovation, optimizing its operations, and shaping listing policies.
:::

By design, MEX serves as both a value capture mechanism and an incentive tool, ensuring that its benefits scale with adoption, fostering a sustainable value cycle for all stakeholders.

A locked form of MEX, namely [xMEX](/xmex-and-energy/xme/.d), is used to incentivize liquidity provision. All xMEX rewards are locked for four years by default. xMEX is untradeable and unsendable. However, a user may shorten the locking period or redeem xMEX for MEX at any time, although with a penalty.
