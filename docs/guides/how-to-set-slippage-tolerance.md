To access the settings of the xExchange, open the menu on the right-hand side.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

</div>

On the very bottom, you will see the settings category, which allows you to adjust a few options to your liking.

### Slippage Tolerance

Here you can change how much slippage you are willing to accept before your swap gets canceled. It is advised to set the slippage to one of the three presets.

If you have a slippage of 5%, it means that the swap will only be executed, as long as the price doesnâ€™t change more than 5% on the negative side.

A higher slippage ultimately leads to more risk, so use higher slippages with care!
