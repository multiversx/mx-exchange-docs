You can either harvest the rewards individually, all at once, or directly reinvest all rewards. Not all options are applicable for all farms. Some are only available for Metastaking.

“Harvest” - harvests the available reward for that position. Rewards thus become available in your balances

“Reinvest” - reinvests the available reward for that position. Rewards are thus automatically staked into the farm. The rewards lock mechanism will be identical to the one for that position.

“Harvest all” - harvests all the available rewards for all the positions, at once. Rewards thus become available in your balances.

“Reinvest all” - reinvests all the available rewards for all positions. All the rewards are thus automatically staked into the farm. The rewards lock mechanisms will be identical to the respective positions.
