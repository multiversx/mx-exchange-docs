## Token Swaps

Users can trade or swap an amount of tokens for an automated computed amount from the second token. The Automated Market Making concept relies on a mathematical formula to price assets. Instead of using an order book like a traditional exchange, assets are priced according to a pricing algorithm.

xExchange uses the Uniswap-like constant product formula x \* y = k, where x is the amount of one token in the liquidity pool, and y is the amount of the other. In this formula, k is a fixed constant, meaning the poolâ€™s total liquidity always has to remain the same.

:::tip
Swapping tokens incurs a **0.3%** fee.

As part of that fee:
- **0.2%** goes to liquidity providers based on their share of the liquidity pool.

- **0.05%** is used to buy back and burn MEX from the EGLD/MEX pool.

- The final **0.05%** is distributed to all accounts with [Energy](/xmex-and-energy/what-is-energy.md).
